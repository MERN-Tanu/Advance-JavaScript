/\* Main axis and cross axis
The two axes of flexbox
When working with flexbox you need to think in terms of two axes â€” the main axis and the cross axis. The main axis is defined by the flex-direction property, and the cross axis runs perpendicular to it. Everything we do with flexbox refers back to these axes, so it is worth understanding how they work from the outset.

The main axis
The main axis is defined by flex-direction, which has four possible values:

row
row-reverse
column
column-reverse
